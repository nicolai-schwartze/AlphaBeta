# AlphaBeta
An optical character recognition (OCR) based app to learn new scripts and alphabets. 

Originally, this app was meant to practice the [Thai Script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thai_script#Alphabetic) and the implemented OCR model is based on [OpenThaiGPT/thai-trocr](https://huggingface.co/openthaigpt/thai-trocr).

By switching to a different OCR model, the concept could be extended to any other language and script.
